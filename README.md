# Jungard: A Troublesome Unreality

This will be a text-based RPG adventure.

## Story

The inhabitants of Jungard have only known a peaceful era. There has
been no war. An unconscious desire to coexist has never been
challenged.

However, many are growing restless. Their tranquil reality is being
disrupted by nightmares. It has swept rapidly across the land,
starting with the council houses in the north. Your village at the
southwestern tip of the continent seems to be the only one unaffected,
but for how long?

Many are beginning to panic. They are unable to work, play, or
socialise as they used to. They'll nod off during the day, but cannot
sleep for long due to their violent dreams. Some are even growing
irritable, and getting into arguments and fights with one another.

How will the people of Jungard go on like this? They've always
prevailed over hardship, but how can you conquer what is not real?

## Concepts
* Gender/sexless character creation, but maybe pronouns
* Methods of interaction based on quirks/perks (GURPS-like)
* Maybe also specify fears which determine where you start in the
dream world and what the enemies are like
* Night and day
* Sleeping takes you into the hive mind dream world
* A few characters may sleep during the day so you can only interact
with them if you do the same
* Enemies are nightmares
* The first time it'll throw the player off cause they'll be sleeping
and then it's like oh I must have woken up because it's daytime now
and then they see freaky shit
* The music will all be slight variations between the dream world and
the normal world
* Maybe some people can't wake up because they're trapped in their nightmares
* Nightmares are trying to break into the real world
* Timed objectives with consequences
* Maybe you can be scared out of your dreams and you need to learn to
conquer your fears (maybe a courage attribute) before you can fight
the bosses
* Courage level affects how much fatigue is restored
* D&D-style dice roll actions
* Dying in your dream wakes you up and has other effects (TBD)
* Dying in real life takes you to your last awakening (more incentive to sleep)
* 7 quadrants (septants? idk)
* Fears: heights, darkness, death, water, snakes
